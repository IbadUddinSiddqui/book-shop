Step-by-Step Development Plan
Set Up Pages and Components in Next.js

Create base pages (Home, Categories, Bestsellers, Exclusive, Contact).
Set up component files in a /components folder for the header, footer, hero section, and any reusable UI elements.
Define Color Palette in Tailwind CSS Config

Set primary colors: white and green for the main theme.
Define accent colors: dark shades and gold for highlighting.
You’ll have the flexibility to use bg-green-500, text-gold, etc., for different areas.
Develop Each Section Step-by-Step

Start with the Header and Footer since they will be consistent across pages.
Build the Hero Section on the homepage, setting up the main banner image and CTA button.
Develop the Categories and Bestsellers Sections, incorporating the black and gold theme for bestsellers.
Add styling and responsive design for mobile.
Add Interactivity and Animations

Use Tailwind transitions (e.g., hover:bg-gold, hover:scale-105) for buttons and cards.
Incorporate a fade-in effect or slide-in animations on scroll for sections like Bestsellers.
Testing and Refining

Test the design on different screen sizes to ensure readability and contrast.
Adjust color contrasts if any section is too dark or light for readability.
